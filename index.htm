<h2 class="center-1 "> Active Ingredient of Aloe vera</h2>
<h4  class="center-2 "> An Ancient Herb for Modern Dentistry</h4>
<p  class="center-3 ">The Aloe barbadensis plant consists of two different parts, each of which produces substances with completely different compositions and therapeutic properties. The parenchymal tissue makes up the inner portion of the aloe leaves and produces the Aloe vera gel (or mucilage), a clear, thin, tasteless, jelly-like material. This tissue is recovered from the leaf by separating the gel from the inner cellular debris.</p>

<p id="pera03"  class="center-4 ">The other part of the plant is a group of specialized cells known as the pericyclic tubules, which occur just beneath the outer green ring of the leaf. These cells produce an exudate that consists of bitter yellow latex with powerful laxative-like actions. This exudate, which is not to be confused with the gel/mucilage from the parenchymal leaf tissue, is available commercially for systemic ingestion to produce catharsis 
    <br>More than 75 active ingredients from inner gel have been identified including vitamins, minerals, enzymes, sugars, anthraquinones or phenolic compounds, lignin, saponins, sterols, amino acids, and salicylic acid. Active ingredients of Aloe vera leaf pulp and exudates were depicted in Table

    <h2 class="center-1 ">Shades and Combinations</h2>
    <h4  class="center-2 ">What Do Pink Roses Represent?</h4>
    <p  class="center-3 ">The pink rose’s meaning ranges from gentle love to affection to appreciation. Where the red rose screams intensity and passion, the pink rose subtly expresses more refined feelings. The pink rose means elegance, appreciation, congratulations, first love, or happiness. Pink roses have different meanings depending upon their depth of color.</p>
    
    <p  class="center-4 ">Darker pink roses express thanks and gratitude, while the medium shades of pink are for congratulations. Medium-pink roses could be sent to congratulate someone on the arrival of a new baby, career success, or graduation.
        <br>
        Send darker shades of pink roses to show your appreciation for those who have helped you. These darker shades of pink can also be used to express how thankful you are just for having them in your life. This applies best to platonic relationships rather than impassioned love relationships. Save red roses for those occasions.
